# Explosion Wand Mod

This is a test mod I wrote to understand how to throw TNT.  (It's a pretty common desire!)  The only actual important code here is in com.atalhlla.util.minecraft.EntityHelpers with throwEntity(), which is a plain ol conversion of angular heading to XYZ component vectors.

## Project Setup

Only the sources are included so that you may import them into your Eclipse workspace however you want.

I like [this setup here, as explained by MrrGingerNinja](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2413773-172-modding-with-forge-1-jdk-eclipse-forge-and-gradle/).

I made a lot of things into instanceables rather than static classes because I'm going through an experimental phase.

## License

This code is so basic that I'm not sure it's really protectable, or should be protected, for that matter.

Art assets are available under WTFPL.
