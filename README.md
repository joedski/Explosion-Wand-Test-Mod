# Explosion Wand Mod

This is a test mod I wrote to understand how to throw TNT.  (It's a pretty common desire!)  The only actual important code here is in com.atalhlla.util.minecraft.EntityHelpers with throwEntity(), which is a plain ol conversion of angular heading to XYZ component vectors.

## License

This code is so basic that I'm not sure it's really protectable, or should be protected, for that matter.
